                    If you are on this website and is a true reaper you have probably heard of Captain Flameheart. Flameheart is the greatest ashen skeleton lord to ever exist and he just so happens to the father of the Servant of the flame who is the great leader of this feared faction. He has a great army of ghostships that he will eventually use to destroy the Sea of thieves once and for all.

                <p>
                    If you really want to honor the father of our fantastic leader you can get the sails of the burning blade. All you need to do to honor the flame is to find his little ghostfleet and say hello to him a couple times and while he will probably attack you it will be worth it in the end.
